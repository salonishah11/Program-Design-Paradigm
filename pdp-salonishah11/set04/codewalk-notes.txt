Presentation: A

Notes:

- Test cases failed on changing constants, write test cases using constants
- Follow style guide, camel casing for all data definitions
- Be consistent about the names for your data definition types throughout the program
- Redundant calls to make-rect in all helper functions, could have decomposed rect once and delegated individual properties to helper functions
- Avoid early decomposition, pass only those parameters that you want to change and not all
